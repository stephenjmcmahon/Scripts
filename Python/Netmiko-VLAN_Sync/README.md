# üîÑ VLAN Sync - Automated VLAN Synchronization for Cisco Switches
This Python script automates VLAN synchronization across Cisco IOS-XE switches. It ensures VLAN name consistency by:
- Fetching VLAN data from a core switch.
- Allowing the user to review VLANs before applying changes.
- Syncing access/distribution switches to match the core.
- Logging all changes for auditing and troubleshooting.

# üìå Installation & Setup

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python & Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It‚Äôs best to use a **Python virtual environment** to keep dependencies isolated.

**Ensure Python 3 is installed**

        python3 --version

**Install virtualenv if not already installed**

        pip3 install virtualenv

**Create a virtual environment**

        python3 -m venv vlan-sync-env

**Activate the virtual environment**

        source vlan-sync-env/bin/activate

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
This script requires the following Python packages:

- Netmiko (for SSH automation)
- Argparse (for command-line arguments)
- JSON (for handling VLAN data)
- Datetime (for timestamped logs)
- OS (for file handling)
- Re (Regex) (for parsing switch output)
- To install them manually, run:

        pip install netmiko

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up VLANs & Switches
- Edit switches.json (Switch List) manually
- or use convert_switches.py to automatically format a list of "hostname IPADDRESS" switches per line in a switches_list.txt file. You will still need to manually define the Core switch.
-        switches_list.txt should be in the following format per line:
                switchhostname1 192.168.1.1
                switchhostname2 192.168.1.2
- Define the core switch (where VLANs are retrieved from).
- List all distribution/access switches that need to be synced.
- Note: core_vlans.json will be automatically created from the core switch.

# üöÄ Running the Script
The script supports command-line arguments to allow flexible execution.

**Fetch VLANs from the Core (Only)**
- Connects to the core switch.
- Retrieves VLANs and saves them in core_vlans.json.
- Displays the VLAN list for review before syncing.

        python3 vlan_sync.py --fetch


**Sync VLANs to Access Switches (Using Existing core_vlans.json)**
- Reads VLANs from core_vlans.json and applies them to access switches.

        python3 vlan_sync.py --sync

**Full Automation (Fetch VLANs & Sync)**
- Fetches VLANs from the core and syncs them to access switches.

        python3 vlan_sync.py --all
